task5 project overview
========================================================================

In this project you continue to work with custom classes and data structures from previous assignments, but now your collection should comply with STL principles: all the algorithmic operations, such as search, should be moved in another class, and access to the elements of the data structure should go from iterator only. Pay attention that here we're working with binary seach tree, so we don't have sort functions in Algorithm class.
